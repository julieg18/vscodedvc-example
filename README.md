# vscodedvc-example
1. Install dvc (you can run `make venv` to create a virtual environment `.venv` with dvc)
2. Open VS code with the DVC extension and look at `params_preprocessing.yaml` in columns.
 
The hierarchy of `example` in the yaml file is broken in the standard output from the DVC extension (in the Experiments tab).

The desired output would keep the hierarchy and have just a single `example` column, below it a single `steps` column etc.
